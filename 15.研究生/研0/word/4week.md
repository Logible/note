1. send the **sanitized** data to an untrusted server
2. Each point has its corresponding **tuple** of latitude and longitude.
3. we propose a pivot sampling perturbation mechanism
4. We first **identify** the adjacent points **preceding** and following a target point in the trajectory **as** its pivots.
5. A pivot of the target point is treated as an **origin**
6. It is worth noting that
7. **In contrast** to pivot sampling **leveraging** bi-directional information to confine a single pointâ€™s perturbed result
8. it is also possible to confine the **spatial** region of an entire trajectory
9. We also propose a **guideline** on choosing the direction granularity
