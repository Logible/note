1. The expectation is a one-number **summary** of the distribution.
2. The fact that E(X).. is actually more than a **heuristic**;
3. that $∫xdF(x)$ has a **precise** meaning that is discussed in real analysis courses.
4. Using **integration by parts**,
5. we **implicitly** assume that they exist.
6. March, Mars

## 0718

1. the integral of the product of x and the probability density function (PDF) f(x) **with respect to** x.
2. Take a stick of **unit length** and break it at random

## 0719

1. the term "spread" refers to the extent or **dispersion_1** of the values in a distribution. It quantifies how the data points are distributed or **scattered** around the central value, such as the mean.
2. The answer is that we compute the mean of X **as before** but we substitute fX|Y (x|y) for fX(x) in the definition of expectation.

## 0720

1. Draw a **county** at random from the United States.
2. since it **varies** from county to county
3. A distribution that is constructed **in stages** like this is called a **hierarchical_1** model
4. we can **interchange** the operations of differentiation(微分) and “taking expectation.”
