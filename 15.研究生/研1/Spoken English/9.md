Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

我想举杯庆祝下，小小的碰下杯子。我知道这不是你们计划的感恩节，但是对我来说已经很好了，因为没有离婚和呕吐。如果你去维尔的话，如果你们大家都跟家人在一起的话，如果你没得梅毒的话，我们就不会在一起了。所以我想说的是，非常感谢你们的感恩节如此糟糕
