All: Oh!

Joey: Yeah, they said I acted/ˈæktɪd/ too much with-it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre/ˈθɪətə/, expecting/ɪkˈspektɪŋ/ to see me, and...

他们说我表演的太用力了。我跟每个人都说了，现在他们都要去电影院看我

Rachel: Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.

你知道的，没人能区分的

Joey: My mom will.

Chandler: Something so sweet-and...disturbing about that.

真贴心但是却有点不适

Joey: Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy/ˈkræpi/ plays for six years. And I finally get my shot/ʃɒt/, and I blow it!

六年来，我除了演一些奇奇怪怪的剧之外，一事无成。我终于拿到了角色，但是却搞砸了

blow sth.:搞砸某事

Monica: Maybe this wasn't your shot.

也许这不是你的机会

Ross: Yeah, I mean... I think-when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like-your shot..?

我的意思是说，当是你的角色的时候，你会知道那就是你的角色

Joey: Hard to tell, I was naked.

很难说，我当时衣服都没穿

Phoebe: No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think-you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that/ some kid is gonna run up to his friends/frɛndz/ and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.

我觉得那不是你的角色。你甚至都没有觉得你拿到了角色。我真的觉得你会做一些大事情，我真的这么认为。你只需要这么想，有一天有孩子跑到他们的朋友面前说：我拿到角色了，我拿到角色了，我要扮演joey的屁股

Joey: Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)

(Ross and Chandler look at each other and hug as well.)

Monica: I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

All: Night.

Rachel: Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?

你要把鞋子放这里吧

Monica: (determined) Uh-huh!

Rachel: Really? Just casually/ˈkæʒjʊəlɪ/ strewn/struːn/ about in that reckless haphazard/ˌhæpˈhæzəd/ manner?

你的鞋子就这么随便放着吗？

strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner：随意乱放

Monica: Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her room.)

没关系，我明天来拿，或者不来拿

Ross: She is-a kook.

他是个懒人

Closing Credits

[Scene: Monica's Bedroom, she's lying in bed wide awake.]

Monica: (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If-it bothers/ˈbɑːðərz/ you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put-them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head in her pillow.)

如果让你这么烦的话，就到外面去拿鞋子。不要这样，这太傻了，我不需要证明什么，我要去拿，这样的话所有的人都会知道了，除非我先去拿，然后起得很早再放回去。我需要帮忙
