Phoebe: Wait here. Breathe.

(Phoebe goes over to speak to Janice. She talks to her for a few seconds, and then Janice immediately smiles, hugs her, waves to Chandler, and leaves.)

Chandler: How do you do that?

Phoebe: It's like a gift.

Chandler: We should always always break up together.

Phoebe: Oh, I'd like that.

我的腰围曾经也是24寸，你丢东西了。拜托，滚远点

Rachel: All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!

听我说，这位女士，如果你要这个篮子的话，你就一起把我带走好了

(She thinks it over, and then walks away.)

Rachel: (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?

Ross: You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.

太了不起了，全新的女人

Rachel: I could not have done this without you.

没有你的话，我就做不到这些

Ross: Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.

烘干机里还有衣服

Rachel: Are you sure?

Ross: No.
