1- M： Hi, Lily, how's the new apartment?
2- W ：It's okay.
3- M： What? How can it be just okay when last week you were thrilled about the place and kept posting
photos of it online?
4- W ：Well? last week when I moved in, the apartment seemed cozy, just the right size for one person. But now it just seems tiny, shabby and solitary.
5- M： Ah, that's the problem. You miss your roommates from university? don't you?
6- W ：Tm going to sound like an idiot, because I used to complain to you all the time about how crowded our dormitory room was? and about all the things they did to irritate me, like watching movies late at night
without headphones ? or talking loudly early in the morning. But now I miss them terribly.
7-M ：Of course you do. That's perfectly normal. When I got m y first place I remember thinking I couldn't wait to live by myself and get away from m y juvenile roommates and all their annoying habits. But then I began missing them and feeling lonely and thinking that our dormitory was like paradise? even though there were six of us guys in one small room.
8-W ：I thought it was just me who felt like that.
9- M：Look, you lived at home with us, and then you had three roommates9 and this is your first time living alone. So it's hard. But your first apartment is a milestone in your life, and you should celebrate it. Tell me about the apartment.
10-W：Actually? it's not bad. In fact, it's pretty adorable? now that I have decorated it and it has everything I need. I have a kitchen to cook in and a bathroom all to myself, and then another room with m y bed at one end? and a sofa? a small table and chairs at the other end.
11-M：That does sound adorable and I can't wait to see it, and neither can m o m and dad.

1- W ：Welcome to our program Book Talk. Our guest today is Frank Jones, a critic of our education system, and the author of a new book, Hoxv to Reform Our Universities.
2- M ：Hello? Susan.
3- W ：Frank, you support radically changing universities in America?
4- M ：回 Yes, I believe that the purpose of higher education is to prepare young people to enter the workforce, and that our current system fails to do this. We're allocating too many resources to disciplines that don't match the needs of employers.
5- W ： I think your attitude to education is a bit cynical, Frank. Surely the purpose of university is to prepare young people to participate fully in civic life? rather than just to find well-paid jobs.
6- M ： Susan, many young graduates struggle to find any job, let alone a good one. The job market is grim, particularly for students w ho study the arts.
7- W ：I agree that it isn't easy for young people to find work, but you propose closing down all departments that aren,t directly related to science and technology. Is that really the solution?
8-M ：You're overstating m y point. M y argument is that we need to use more of our budget on areas like science and engineering. To do that? we need to take money from subjects like literature and music.
9- W ： But the arts have value. They're an important part of our culture. ® Studying literature or music or sculpture might not result in a job in that area, but it helps young people to think about the world in a deeper way? which makes them better citizens and makes for a better society.
10-M ： I agree that the arts are valuable to society, but it's naive to think that not only the most talented? but all students should study them at university level. The arts are very competitive ? and most graduates will end up with a great deal of debt, obtaining a degree that has little value on the job market.
