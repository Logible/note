# internal properties

Internal properties define the behavior of code as it executes but are not accessible via code. ECMAScript difines many internal properties for objects in JavaScript.

Internal properties are indicated by double-square-bracket notation<code style="color:#ea4335">[[]]</code>

For example, Javascript function is an object and it has [[call]] property. [[call]] properties is unique to function

Another internal property example is [[prototype]] properties. This property is a pointer pointing back to the prototype object that the instance is using. Since internal property cannot be accessed via code, an object instantiation cannot access to the prototype while its properties are all availavle to the object.

You can get the value of [[prototype]] property by using Object.getPrototypeOf() method on an Object.

```js
var obj = new Object();
var prototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);

console.log(prototype == Object.prototype);
console.log(obj.prototype);//undefined
```
