- <http://www.example.com/dir2/other.html>: same-origin
- <http://example.com/dir/other.html>: different in domain name
- <http://v2.www.example.com/dir/other.html>: different in domain name
- <http://www.example.com:81/dir/other.html>: different in domain port
- <https://www.example.com/dir/page.html>: different in domain name protocal
