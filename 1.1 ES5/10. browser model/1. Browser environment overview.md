# Browser environment overview

## 1.The method of embeding the code in a webpage

There are cheif four methods for embeding the code in a webpage:

- The <code style="color:#ea4335">\<script></code> element is directly embedded in the code
- The <code style="color:#ea4335">\<script></code> tag loads an external script
- Event property
- URL protocol

### 1.1 scirpt element embeds code

### 1.2 script element loads an external script

To prevent attackers from tampering with external scripts,
scirpt tag allows to set an integrity property to write the hash signature of the external script, it is used to verify the consistency of the script.

```js
<script src="/assets/application.js"
  integrity="sha256-TvVUHzSfftWg1rcfL6TIJ0XKEGrgLyEq6lEpcmrG9qs=">
</script>
```

In the above code, the SHA256 signature of the external script <code style="color:#ea4335">/assets/application.js</code> is specified. Once someone changed the script, the SHA256 signature did not match, the browser will refuse to load.

### 1.3 Event property

```js
<button id="myBtn" onclick="console.log(this.id)">点击</button>
```

### 1.4 URL protocol

URL supports <code style="color:#ea4335">javascript:</code> protocol, that is write the code in the position of URL. The JavaScript code will be executed when using this URL.

```js
<a href="javascript:console.log('Hello')">点击</a>
```

If the JavaScript code returna string return a string, the browser will create a new document to display the content of the string and the content of the original document will disappear.

```js
<a href="javascript: new Date().toLocaleTimeString();">点击</a>
```

The commonly usage of <code style="color:#ea4335">javascript</code> protocol is Bookmarklet.

## 2.script element

### 2.1 working principle

The following is the normal web page loading process:

1. The browser downloads the HTML page and starts parsing at the same time.
2. During the parsing process, when the browser finds the <code style="color:#ea4335">\<script></code> element, it pauses the parsing, transfer control of web page rendering to the JavaScript engine.
3. If the <code style="color:#ea4335">\<script></code> element references an enternal script, download the script and execute it.
4. The JavaScript engine is executed, return control the rendering engine, resume to parse the HTML page down.

If the external script takes a long time to load (the download has not been completed), then the browser will wait for the script download to complete, causing the wbe page to lose response for a long time. This is called the "blocking effect".

In order to avoid this situation, it is better to put all the <code style="color:#ea4335">\<script></code> tags at the bottom of the page isntead of the head. In this way, even if the script becomes unresponsive, the rendering of the main body of the web page has been completed. The user can at least see the content instead of facing a blank page.

If there are multiple script tag, such as

```js
<script src="a.js"></script>
<script src="b.js"></script>
```

the browser will download <code style="color:#ea4335">a.js</code> and <code style="color:#ea4335">b.js</code> in parallel at the same time. However, it will ensure that <code style="color:#ea4335">a.js</code> is executed first and then <code style="color:#ea4335">b.js</code> when executed, this is true even if the latter is downloaded first.

- Parsing and executing CSS will also cause blocking.

  - the Firefox browser will wait until all the style sheets in front of the script are downloaded and parsed and then execute the scritp.
  - the Webkit will suspend the execution of the script once it finds that the script references a style, wait util the style sheet is downloaded and parsed, and then resume execution.
