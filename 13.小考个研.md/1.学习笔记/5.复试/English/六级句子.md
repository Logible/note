- W: Ah↑, an exit interview. Are you looking forward / to it?
- M: I'm not sure/ how I feel-about-it. I resigned / because I've been unhappy /at that company for a long time, but I'm not sure-if / I should tell them / how I really feel.
- W: To my way of th'inking', there are two main potential benefits/ that 'come' from /unleashing an agitated stream-of truth/ during↑ an exit interview.
