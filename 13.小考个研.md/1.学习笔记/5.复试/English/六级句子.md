- M: It-is my l'a'st day at w'or'k / tomorrow. I 'start' my new job-in two weeks. My human↑ resources manager wants to conduct-an interview with me / before I leave.
- W: Ah↑, an 'e'xit interview. Are you looking forward / to it?
- M: I'm not sure/ how I feel-about-it. I resigned / because I've been unhappy /at that company for a long time, but I'm not sure-if / I should tell them / how I really feel.
- W: To my way of th'inking', there are two main potential benefits/ that 'come' from /un'lea'shing an agitated stream-of truth/ during↑ an exit interview.

- The first / is release. Unb'ur'de'ning' yourself-of 'fru'stration/ and perh'a'ps-even anger↑ / to someone who isn't-a friend-or close coll'ea'gue / can be wond'er'fully↑ freeing.

- And let me guess. The s'e'cond/ is that the criticism will, theoretically/θɪəˈretɪkli/, help the organization I'm leaving to improve↑, making sure employees-of the future↑ are less likely to encounter what I did↑?

- W: That's right. But the problem with the company improvement part/ is that very often↑ it doesn't happen.
- An exit interview is supposed to be private, but often isn't. In my company, the information gained /from these interviews is often not confidential.
- and the information is used as dirt/ against-another manager. or can be trad'e'd /among senior managers.

- Now you've got me reth'in'king/ what I'll disclose in the interview. There is always the chance /that it could affect my reputation/ and my ability to network-in the industry, It 'i's a pretty small industry after all.
- Anything you initially gained/ from the instant satisfaction of/ telling-it like-it-is, you might lose down the track/ by injuring your future career /kəˈrɪə/ prospects.

- Right, Perhaps-it'll be / better getting things off my chest by going to one of those / rate-your-employer websites.
- You could. And don't do the interview at all. Exit interviews are not mandatory.
