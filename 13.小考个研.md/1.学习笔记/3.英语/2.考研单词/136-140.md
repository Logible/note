"Sustainability" has become a popular word these days/, but to Ted Ning, the concept will always have personal meaning./ Having endured a painful period of unsustainability in his own life/ made it clear to him that/ sustainability-oriented values must be expressed through everyday action and choice. /Ning recalls spending a confusing year /in the late 1990s selling insurance. He'd been through the **dot-corn** boom and burst and, desperate for a job, signed on with a Boulder agency.

“承受能力”已经在最近变成了一个流行的词语,但对于Ted Ning来说,这个概念将有一些个人的含义. 在他自己的生活中经受了一段不可承受的痛苦时期**后(add)**,**使(delete)**他清楚地认识到,承受能力的导向价值必须通过每日的行动和选择进行表达. Ning回忆了经历的困惑的一年,这一年他在90年代末卖保险. Ning已经经历了危机爆发,非常想要一份工作,便和Boulder公司签订了合同.

答案: 最近,“承受力”成了一个流行词,但对泰德·宁来说,**他对其含义有自己(亲身)的体会**. 在经历了一段无法承受的痛苦生活后,他清楚地认识到,**旨在(提高)承受力的价值观只有通过每日的行为和抉择才能得到(体现)**. 宁回忆起**90年代后期销售保险时**那困惑的一年. **在经历了网络泡沫的膨胀和破灭后**,他急需找到一份工作,因此就与博尔德公司签了约.

It didn't go well. "It was a really bad move because that's not my passion," says Ning, whose dilemma about the job translated, predictably, into a lack of sales. "I was miserable. I had so much anxiety that I would wake up in the middle of the night and stare at the ceiling. I had no money and needed the job. Everyone said, 'Just wait, you'll turn the comer, give it some time."'

但(**情况**)并不顺利. “**这的确是糟糕的一步**,因为它激不起我的工作热情. ”宁说. 不出所料,**工作上的进退维谷造成他销售业绩不佳**. “我很痛苦,愁肠百结,常常在半夜惊醒,望着天花板发愣. 我身无分文,需要(**这份**)工作. 大家都说,‘等等看,过一段时间情况会好转的. ”

它进展得并不顺利,“它真的是一个不好的去处因为那不是我的兴趣”,Ning说,可以预见的是,他的工作转为缺少销售,“我当时很痛苦,我是如此地焦虑以至于我会在半夜醒来然后凝视着天花板”我没有钱且需要工作,每个人都说：“再等等,你会时来运转,给它一些时间”
