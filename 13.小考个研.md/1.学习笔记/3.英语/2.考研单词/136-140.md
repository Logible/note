## 141 Translation

"Sustainability" has become a popular word these days/, but to Ted Ning, the concept will always have personal meaning./ Having endured a painful period of unsustainability in his own life/ made it clear to him that/ sustainability-oriented values must be expressed through everyday action and choice. /Ning recalls spending a confusing year /in the late 1990s selling insurance. He'd been through the dot-corn boom and burst and, desperate for a job, signed on with a Boulder agency.

“承受能力”已经在最近变成了一个流行的词语，但对于Ted Ning来说，这个概念将有一些个人的含义。在他自己的生活中经受了一段不可承受的痛苦时期，使他清楚地认识到，承受能力的导向价值必须通过每日的行动和选择进行表达。Ning回忆了经历的困惑的一年，这一他在90年代末卖保险。Ning已经经历了危机爆发，非常想要一份工作，便和Boulder公司签订了合同。

It didn't go well. "It was a really bad move because that's not my passion," says Ning, whose dilemma about the job translated, predictably, into a lack of sales. "I was miserable. I had so much anxiety that I would wake up in the middle of the night and stare at the ceiling. I had no money and needed the job. Everyone said, 'Just wait, you'll turn the comer, give it some time."'

它进展得并不顺利，“它真的是一个不好的去处因为那不是我的兴趣”，Ning说，可以预见的是，他的工作转为缺少销售，“我当时很痛苦，我是如此地焦虑以至于我会在半夜醒来然后凝视着天花板”我没有钱且需要工作，每个人都说：“再等等，你会时来运转，给它一些时间”
