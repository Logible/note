# 3.名词(短语)和名词性从句

## 概念

- 同位语
  - 同位结构（英语：Apposition）是指一种在相邻的句子成分之间存在修饰、限定或说明关系的结构，这些句子成分常是名词性成分。修饰另一个成分的成分叫同位语，被修饰的成分叫本语。例如，在“我的朋友爱丽丝”中，“爱丽丝”是“我的朋友”的同位语，同时它们也构成了同位结构。

1. 在非限制性同位结构中，后一成分在补充修饰前一成分时不需要变形，对整句的意思来说也并不重要
2. 而在限制性同位结构中，后一成分限定或阐明前一成分，起重要作用。
   1. 例如：在“我的朋友爱丽丝”中，“爱丽丝”具体指明了“我的朋友”是谁，因此这一结构是限制性的。
   2. 再例如：“我夫人，一位训练有素的护士”中的“一位训练有素的护士”并没有缩小“我夫人”所指的范围，但却提供了补充信息，因此这一结构是非限制性的。
   3. 在英语中，非限制性同位语和本位语之间常用**逗号**隔开，但限制性同位语和本位语之间常**不会用逗号**隔开;

- 名词充当的成分

1. 主语
   1. The book looks terrific.
2. 宾语
   1. I appereciate the man.
3. 表语
   1. He becomes a businessman.
4. 同位语：用来解释名词的成分
   1. I enjoy the part, the end.
   2. I love kitty, a peculiar girl.
   3. My boyfriend, a undergraduate, from civil engeenring, looks handsome.
   4. Overfishing, a universal issue throughout the world, has become increaingly fearful under modern conditions.

- 名词性从句
  
⭐从句：由引导词引导

名词在句子中能充当的成分，从句都可以充当

1. 主语从句
   1. **What I read** looks terrific.
2. 宾语从句
   1. I appreciate what he did.
3. 表语从句
   1. He becomes who we should learn from.
4. 同位语从句
   1. I enjoy the part that they stay together.

- 名词性从句的引导词

按照从句类型分类，分成三类

1. That: 陈述句，不充当任何成分，只起引导作用
2. Whether: 一般疑问句 翻译成是否，从句中依然不充当任何成分
3. 所有特殊疑问词when what where how: 特殊疑问句，英语中所有从句都是陈述句形式，也就是引导词加主语加谓语

1. 他已经离婚了是我的错(句子不能当主语)————陈述句
   1. **That** He has got divorced is my fault.
2. 他离婚了吗是显而易见的————一般疑问句 回答：yes or no

repeated翻译为？

能够快速地识别各个名词性从句，并能把它们快速地翻译出来:

1. 如何识别主语从句
   1. 引导词在句首，且从句后没有被逗号隔开
      1. 反之则是状语从句
   2. 主语从句从句首开始，到**主句的谓语动词前**结束
   3. example
      1. That the plates are(助动词) moving **is** now beyond dispute.
         1. 显而易见，现在板块正在移动

         1. n.+n.+定语, 定语修饰前面所有名词
         2. and: 介词 + 名词 + 定语
   4. besides, it...that也通常是主语从句，从**that开始到句末结束**，it只是形式主语

      2. For example, it **has**(帮助谓语构成现在完成时) long **been(帮助谓语构成被动,二者都是助动词) known** that total sleep deprivation is 100 percent fatal to rats, yet(连词连接两个主系表), upon examination of the dead bodies, the animals look completely normal.

2. 如何识别宾语从句
   1. 实义动词的后面有引导词，通常都是宾语从句(还可能是状语从句哟)
      1. She **said** (that) she would marry an old rich.
            1. that可省略
      2. I **wonder** if I can pass the national postgraduate entrance examination smoothly.

3. 如何识别表语从句
   1. 系动词的后面有引导词，通常都是表语从句

      2. Galileo's greatest glory **was** that in 1609 he was the first person to turn the newly invented telescope on the heavens prove that the planets revolve around the sun rather than around the Earth.

4. 如何识别同位语从句
   1. 只要在名词后面有引导词，就暂定为同位语从句(可能是定语从句-大多数)
      1. Being interested in the relationship of language and thought, Whorf **developed** the idea (名词后)that the structure of language determines the structure of habitual thought in a society,
      2. **Evidence** came up that specific speech sounds are recognized by babies as young as six months old.(同位语从句后置)
