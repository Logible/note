      1. N.(先行词) + 引导词 + 句子
   2. 引导词
      1. 按先行词的种类分类，共为5类, 当线性词是
         1. 是人:

         2. 副词：从句不能充当任何主干成分

   1. that 引导宾语从句的时候，如果在从句中充当宾语，可省略
      1. example
         1. I enjoy the lunch (that) my mother cooks.
      2. 所以见到两个名词/代词放在一起，通常都是省略了that的定语从句
   2. 区别限制和非限制性定语从句

      2. 非限制：后面定语限制不强烈
      3. example
         1. I love kitty who is beautiful.
         2. I love kitty, who is beautiful.

         2. I will never forget the day **on which** I met u.
   4. 区别the same.. as 和 the same that
      1. He is the same man as I love 像
      2. He is the same man that I love 是
   5. **as、which**引导的非限制性定语从句可以修饰前面整句话，但which引导非限制性定语从句只能放在从句的**后面**

      2. I have a dream that I become a rich lady. 同位语
   2. 区别

         1. 定语从句：八个
         2. 同位语：一般是that

7. 定语从句的至难点-寻找先行词
   1. 定语从句的先行词, 就是离它最近的那个名词
      1. When someone abandons you, he is the one **who** should get loss because for him, he loses someone who loves him but for you, you lose someone who does not love you.
   2. 定语从句是它前面几个并列的名词
      1. For workers it can mean an end to the security, benefits and sense of importance **that** came from a loyal employee.
   3. 定语从句的先行词是前面的从句
      1. The Greek assumed that the structure of language had some connection with the process of thought, **which** took root in Europe long before people realized how diverse languages could be.
   4. 定语从句的先行词是前面的整个句子
      1. My husband enjoys talking with other young ladies, **which** really gets me go mad.
   5. 先行词和定语从句间被隔开
      1. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be powerfully expressive--there exists no **language or dialect** in the world **that** cannot convey complex idea.

8. 考点分析-写作
   所有的系动词都无被动
   1. 只要在写作中见到名词,就可以有意识地加定语从句以拉长句子
      1. example1
         1. Raising pets can reduce loneliness.
         2. Raising pets **looking strikingly cute as well as smart** can reduce loneliness of Senior citizens **who have no any descendants**.

      4. 万能句式
         1. looking strikingly adj as well as adj
         2. 抽象名词和复数名词后可以举例子
            1. Reading books such as a Nightingale and a Rose, Little prince, and My dearest mother can broaden horizon of readers.
      5. 英汉差异
         1. 汉语意和, 英语形和
            1. 句子结构
            2. 逻辑关系
            3. 汉语多主动, 英语多被动

            4. 汉语多短语, 英语多长句
               1. 非谓语动词
