what **looks** beyond dispute is that **the proportion** of travel targets of undergraduates, admiring scene accounted for 37%, and releasing pressure accounted for 33%. The meaning of the chart is quite conspicuous. It is undergraduates that tend to travel to admire scenes and release pressure.

The main element for the issue. in my judgment, is that the harder undergraduates work, the more pressure they will have, which **has** been widely accepted by professors and experts in education. In addition, travel is an fantastic thing which means that one can admire the scene, one can make some friends when one is depressed. As consequence, not only does travel exert great **influences** on the healthy of morality, but also gets an **unforgettable** experience in life.

In conclusionï¼Œ travel for undergraduates keeps as useful as sunshine and water, which plays a key role in **the** normal growth of most plants **worldwide**. It seems imperative that teachers in university should encourage their students to travel to admire views and release pressure. Should not we pour attention to the travel target of undergraduates?
