what looks beyond dispute is that in the proportion of the purpose of reading on phone, use for acquiring knowledge accounted for 60%., and other reasons all only accounted for 40%. the meaning of the chart proves quite conspicuous: it is the majority of undergraduates that tend to acquire knowledge through phone reading under modern conditions.

The main element for the issue, in my judgment, is that the more intelligent phones become, the more facilities phones will have. which **paves the way** for undergraduates to acquire knowledge. Additionally, Reading on phone is a convenient thing which means that one can read on the way to class. one can read before sleep even when there are a sea of tasks waiting for us to do. As a consequence, Not only does Reading on phone save the time of undergraduates but also keeps an excellent study habit.

In conclusion, Reading on phone keeps as useful as sunshine and rainwater, which plays a key role in the normal growth of most plants in the world. It seems imperative that teachers in universities should encourage students to use the phone in a right way. Should not we pour attention into the issue of the purpose of reading on phone?
