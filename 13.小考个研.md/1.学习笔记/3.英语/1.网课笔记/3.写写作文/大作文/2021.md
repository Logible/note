what looks beyond dispute is that in the proportion of the exercise style of urban citizens, exercise alone accounted for 54%. on the contrary, exercise with the group only accounted for 20%. the meaning of the chart proves quite conspicuous: it is the majority of exercisers tend to exercise alone **under modern conditions**.

The main element for the issue, in my judgment, is that the more citizens an exercise join, the low efficient they will get. which has been widely accepted by the professors of sports. Additionally, exercising together is a negative thing which means that one is supposed to wait for their partner one should keep **tempo** with partners even when one is **depressed**. As a consequence, Not only does exercise together keep a serious influence but also decreases the passion of the exerciser.

In conclusion, exercise alone keeps as crucial as sunshine and rainwater, which plays a key role in the normal growth of most plants in the world. It seems imperative that communities should encourage their residents not to exercise together. Should not we pour attention into the issue of exercise style?
