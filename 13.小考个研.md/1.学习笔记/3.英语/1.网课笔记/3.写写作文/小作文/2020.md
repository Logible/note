Suppose you are planning a tour of a historical site for a group of international students. Write an email to

1. tell them about the site, and
2. give them some tips for the tour

Dear international student:

I am an undergraduate in the university. I am writing this letter, to tell the truth, in order to tell you about the historical site of the tour.

The site, to begin with, keeps so cool that you are suppose to wear enough clothes in the tour. In addition, it has been widely accepted that the site where we go has one of the most charming scene in China. At last, you must wear mask in the tour although the padanmic is not severe recently.

Thanks for your kind consideration of my advice. I look forward to a favourable reply at your earliest convenience.
