Suppose you are organizing an online meeting. Write an email to Jack, an international student, to

1. invite him to participate
2. and tell him the details.

Dear Sir:

I am an undergraduate from the department of Fine Arts in the university. I am writing this letter, to tell the truth, in order to invite you to participate **in** the graduation meeting.

The meeting, to begin with, keeps so crucial that every senior never fail to join it. It has been widely accepted that the meeting can field almost all questions the seniors have. therefore, you can ask any questions about graduation in the meeting. At last, the meeting will be held in next **Sunday** morning **at** 8:00 am.

Hope that you can join the meeting in time. I look forward to a favourable reply at your earliest convenience.
