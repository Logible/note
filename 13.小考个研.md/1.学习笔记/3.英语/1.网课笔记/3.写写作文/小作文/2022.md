Dear Sir or Madam:

I am **an** undergraduate in the university. I am writing **this** letter, to tell the truth, in order to introduce the food festival to you and invite you to participate.

The campus food festival, to begin with, keeps so **interested** that we never fail to join it every term. In addition, it has been widely accepted that the campus food festival has become the symbol of our university. [therefore], you will make a sea of friends if you join us. At last, all of the food is free although they is indeed delicious.

Hope that you can participate the festival. I look forward to a favourable reply at your earliest convenience.

Yours truly
LiMing.
