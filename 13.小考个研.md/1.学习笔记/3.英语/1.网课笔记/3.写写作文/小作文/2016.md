Dear Jack.

How is every going these days? I am writing this letter, to tell the truth, in order to thank your invitation and give you some advice.

The translation, to begin with, keeps so hard that you are supposed to **practice** in the general routine of everyday living. In addition, it has been widely accepted that the first step **to** success is imitation, therefore, you could involve yourself in the compositions of masters. At last, keep on patient and you will be confident gradually.

Hope that my advice will be useful to you. I look forward to a favourable reply at your earliest convenience.

Yours truly
LiMing.
