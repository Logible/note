Dear Professor Smith.

How is everything going these days? I am writing this letter, to tell to truth, in order to tell you I am not able to visit you next **Sunday**.

The travelï¼Œ to begin with, have to cancel because my brother was ill due to the pandemic. In addition, I feel tired recently for my graduate paper, therefore, there is no time for me to travel and visit you. At last, I would like to meet you after two weeks and hope that I wonder whether You are free at that time.

Please bring my best wish to your family. I **look** forward to a favourable reply at your **earliest** convenience.

Yours truly.

Li Ming.
