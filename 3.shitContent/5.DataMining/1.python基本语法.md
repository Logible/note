# Python基本语法

## 1.判断

```py
a = 1

if a == 1:
    print("a="+str(a))
else:
    print("a is a piece of shit")
```

## 2.循环

1. while循环

    ```py
    s, k = 0, 0
    while k < 101:
        k = k + 1
        s = s + k
    print(s)
    ```

2. for 循环

    ```py
    s = 0
    for k in range(101):
        s = s + k
    print(s)
    ```

    - <code style="color:#ea4335">range()</code>: returns an immutable sequence of numbers between the given start integer to the stop integer.

        Syntax of range()
        range() constructor has two forms of definition:

        ```py
        range(stop)
        range(start, stop[, step])
        ```

        - start - integer starting from which the sequence of integers is to be returned
        - stop - integer before which the sequence of integers is to be returned. The range of integers ends at stop - 1.
        - step (Optional) - integer value which determines the increment between each integer in the sequence

    - <code style="color:#ea4335">in</code> : Definition and Usage
    The in keyword has two purposes:

        - The in keyword is used to check if a value is present in a sequence (list, range, string etc.).

        - The in keyword is also used to iterate through a sequence in a for loop:

## 3.函数

Python use def to define function

```py
def add2(x):
    return x + 2, x+2+2


print(add2(2))
```

Python Lambda

A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

Syntax:

```py
lambda arguments : expression
```

Example:

```py
f = lambda x: x + 2

print(f(5))
```
