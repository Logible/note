# Python 数据结构

Python有4个内建的数据结构, They can be collectively referred to as containers.

1. List
2. Tuple
3. Dictionary
4. Set

## 1. List and Tuple

List and Tuple are sequence structures.

List can be modified, but Tuple not

```py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

```

Copy List

```py
b = c[:]
```

List method:

列表解析：

```py
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = []

for i in a:
    b.append(i+2)

# is equivalent to

b = [i+2 for i in a]
```

## 2.Dictionaries

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

```py
thisDict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

print(thisDict)
```

### 3.Set

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

\* Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

```py
thisSet = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print(thisSet)
```

### 4.Functional Programming

- <code style="color:#ea4335">map()</code>

    This function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (list, tuple etc.) and returns an iterator.

    map() Syntax

    ```py
    map(function, iterable, ...)
    ```

    ```py
    numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


    # returns square of a number
    def square(number):
        return number * number


    squared_numbers_iterator = map(square, numbers)
    squared_numbers = list(squared_numbers_iterator)
    print(squared_numbers)
    ```

- <code style="color:#ea4335">reduce()</code>

    The reduce() function is used to apply a particular function passed in its argument to all of the list elements mentioned in the sequence passed along.This function is defined in “functools” module.

    Syntax

    ```py
    reduce(fun,seq)
    ```

    example:

    ```py
    import functools

    # initializing list
    lis = [1, 3, 5, 6, 2, ]

    # using reduce to compute sum of list
    print("The sum of the list elements is : ", end="")

    print(functools.reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, lis))
    ```

- <code style="color:#ea4335">filter()</code>

    The filter() function extracts elements from an iterable (list, tuple etc.) for which a function returns True.

    Its syntax is:

    ```py
    filter(function, iterable)
    ```

    Example:

    ```py
    even_numbers_iterator = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(1, 10))

    even_numbers = list(even_numbers_iterator)

    print(even_numbers)
    ```
